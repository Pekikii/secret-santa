# secret-santa

This Python script reads participant names from a `participant_names.txt` file and creates a directory with a file for each participant. Each file contains the name of the person they have to buy a gift for.

## Usage

1. Write participant names in `participant_names.txt`
2. `python3 secret-santa.py` to run the script
3. Under strict supervision and without opening them, distribute each file in the newly created folder `matching` to the person whose name matches the file's name.
